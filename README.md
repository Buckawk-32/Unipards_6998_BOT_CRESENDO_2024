# Unipards_6998_BOT_CRESCENDO_2024

## Objectives
1. Swerve
    - For the Swerve code, we already have the swerve code, but I want to optimize and make a new swerve drive code
      - Also, because the fucking mechanic group haven't made the final design

2. PhotonVision
   - Although the connection from our minicomputer to our photon vision and to the roborio will be dealt with by @spig100, the system for it's data to be used for the robot will be done by me.
