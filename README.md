# Unipards_6998_BOT_CRESCENDO_2024

## Objectives
1. Swerve
    - For the Swerve code, we already have the swerve code, but I want to optimize and make sure I understand it completely, so I can teach the rookies about swerve. This will mean that swerve will become a standard for our team.

2. PhotonVision
   - Although the connection from our minicomputer to our photon vision and to the roborio will be dealt with by @spig100, the system for its data to be used for the robot will be done by me.
