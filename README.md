# Unipards_6998_BOT_CRESCENDO_2024

## Objectives

1. Optimization
   - Even though I have some crude subsystems up for the gen 1 robot, they aren't fleshed out every well, and now that
   the gen 1 robot is coming out soon, I should focus on getting our code for Arm and Intake subsystems ready for testing
   . This is especially important as development needs to be fast for our team. I can also rule out PhotonVision,
   as we aren't going to put it on the gen 1 robot just yet.

2. PhotonVision
   - The rigging of the minicomputer with photon-vision is already done by @milkteabox and @spig100, and so the code for
   the data transfer and use on our robot will be done by me, but will have to take a back seat because of gen 1 coming 
   out very soon.
